# Wrap Log

The `wrap-stuff` extension enhances your debugging experience by automatically wrapping your selected code in a `console.log` statement if you're working in JavaScript, or a `var_dump` statement if you're working in PHP. It also removes any quotes in the name of the selected variable.
Also included is a template-literals wrap that wraps the selection with template-literals.
